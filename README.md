# fmriprep_BIDs_toturial 12-Sep-2023
In this tutorial, I will try to give you the keys to store your dataset into a BIDs format and how to launch the basic preprocessing steps using fmriprep.

Here are some information regarding the files:
- BID_config.json is a file that you need to complete the BIDs tutorial.
- sub_01_example.zip and sub_02_example.zip contain data from two subjects. We will use these files to look at the output fmriprep generates and train ourselves to identify good and bad preprocessed data. Note the sub_01_example.zip originally includes 9 runs, but only 3 are included in the report (due to space limitation) in the repository.
- participants.json and participants.tsv are examples of how the file should look in your final folder.
- fmriprep_20.2.1.slurm is an example of the script to use on the cluster


The slides corresponding to the course will come soon!
