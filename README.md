# fmriprep_BIDs_toturial 15-Sep-2023
In this tutorial, I will try to give you the keys to store your dataset into a BIDs format and how to launch the basic preprocessing steps using fmriprep.

Here are some information regarding the files:
- BID_config.json is a file that you need to complete the BIDs tutorial.
- You will also need to download the MRI files we will use during this tutorial. Please find them here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Gx4GdWJEvT5O-2MYjDoyJIiirSpVFV4O/view
- sub_01_example.zip and sub_02_example.zip contain data from two subjects. We will use these files to look at the output fmriprep generates and train ourselves to identify good and bad preprocessed data. Note the sub_01_example.zip originally includes 9 runs, but only 3 are included in the report (due to space limitation) in the repository.
- participants.json and participants.tsv are examples of how the file should look in your final folder.
- fmriprep_20.2.1.slurm is an example of the script to use on the cluster
